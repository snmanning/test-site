    <p>Then I said: 'I shall die with my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;' 
      (Job 29:18, Jewish Publication Society Bible of 1917)</p>

      <p>The phoenix is an evoking image for the abuse survivor because:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>a phoenix lives its life in consuming fire, like a victim being abused</li>
        <li>a phoenix eventually succumbs to the flames, dying </li>
        <li>a phoneix, once dead, will arise anew from its own ashes - evidence of a broken past</li>
        <li> but now, though on fire again, these are the flames of passion for a life renewed</li>
        
      </ol>
